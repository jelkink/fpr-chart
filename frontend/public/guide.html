    <h3>Irish National Election Study 2020</h3>

    <p>This data set is a random subsample of the Irish National Election Study 2020 available on the <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ines2020">Harvard Dataverse repository</a>. After a selection of variables and a random sample of cases are determined, any missing data has been interpolated preserving the univariate distribution---but not taking into account the joint distribution with other variables.</p>
